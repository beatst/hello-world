# hello-world
A rep for discribing my interests, goals, known tools and techniques 

about myself
I was an active (lone wolf) programmer for the web between 1999 and 2013 with some breaks.
I created
- several webpages
- a bible oriented database with comment function
- a cms
- a chat for mentally handicapped people
I since had to shift my focus but in late 2017 started this git account.
There are 2 reasons for this account

1. programming
i'd like to contribute code for others for
- perl
- javascript
- html/css related
- svg/inkscape

2. literature
I'd like to start a literature club for collaborated authoring 
in order to create the most advanced type of (possibly interactive) multimedia literature
If you're interested ...
Watch out for "Geilhart von Sperma"
